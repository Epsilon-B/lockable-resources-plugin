        The newest task has the most chance to be selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        As soon as a resource is available, the newest pending task is selected.<br/>
        If all required resources are available, these resources are locked and the task is started.<br/>
        Else, the second newest task is checked, and so on until finding a task that can be started.
